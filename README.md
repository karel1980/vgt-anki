This project contains scripts to download assets from https://woordenboek.vlaamsegebarentaal.be/ and roll them in an Anki file to help you train your VGT vocabulary.

# What's Anki?

Anki is program to help you learn any topic using flashcard. It's using spaced repetition, which is a fancy way of saying it's good at repeating the hard questions more than the easy ones (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

# What's 'Vlaamse gebarentaal'?

Vlaamse gebarentaal (or VGT for short) is 'Flemish sign language'. It's different from Dutch sign language, and even within VGT there are dialects (but people using different dialects can still communicate).

# Usage

Simply use `./make-all.sh`. This will produce anki packages in under the 'decks' directory.
Try not to overload website. It's not mine and I don't wish to cause it any harm.
